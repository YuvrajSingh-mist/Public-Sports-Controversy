    "Maradona Hand of God": "Prompt for Stance Detection on Maradona's "Hand of God" You are tasked with analyzing comments related to the controversy surrounding Diego Maradona's infamous "Hand of God" goal. Your job is to classify each comment into one of four categories: Favor, Against, Neutral, or Irrelevant. Use the following examples to guide your analysis: About Maradona Hand of God Sport's Controversy: 1) The Handball Goal: The "Hand of God" controversy refers to a key moment in the 1986 FIFA World Cup quarterfinal between Argentina and England. In the 51st minute, Maradona went to challenge England's goalkeeper, Peter Shilton, for a high ball. During the match, Argentine player Diego Maradona scored a goal using his left hand, which is against the rules of football. The referees failed to see the handball, and the goal was allowed to stand, contributing to Argentina's 2-1 victory. Maradona later quipped that the goal was scored "a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God," leading to the incident's enduring nickname. Maradona later referred to it as the "Hand of God," a phrase that became synonymous with the incident. 2) The Second Goal: Just minutes after the controversial goal, Maradona scored another goal by dribbling past multiple English defenders in what has since been called the "Goal of the Century." Argentina went on to win the match 2-1 and eventually won the 1986 World Cup. This controversy highlights a clash between the "spirit of the game" and the "rules of the game." In football, the rules clearly prohibit players from using their hands to manipulate the ball, and the goal should have been disallowed. However, in terms of the "spirit of the game," Maradona's ingenuity and quick thinking were seen by some as a testament to his competitive nature. For others, it was a violation of fair play. The incident has had lasting repercussions in football, often cited as a moment that spurred debates on the importance of strict rule enforcement, the role of referees, and the eventual introduction of technologies like VAR (Video Assistant Referee) to prevent such incidents in the future.

    "Luis Suarez Handball": "Prompt for Stance Detection on Luis Suarez's Handball Controversy Background information regarding the controversy- Context: During the 2010 FIFA World Cup quarterfinal between Ghana and Uruguay, the match was tied 1-1 in extra time. In the final moments, Ghana had a clear goal-scoring opportunity when a header from Dominic Adiyiah was on its way into the net. However, Uruguayan forward Luis SuÃ¡rez deliberately blocked the ball with his hand on the goal line, preventing the goal. Suarez was immediately shown a red card and sent off, and Ghana was awarded a penalty. Unfortunately for Ghana, Asamoah Gyan missed the penalty, and Uruguay eventually won the match in a penalty shootout, denying Ghana the chance to become the first African team to reach a World Cup semifinal. Suarezâ€™s actions were widely debated, with some considering them a heroic sacrifice for his team, while others condemned the unsportsmanlike behavior. Task: Given a text related to Luis Suarez's handball, determine its stance by assigning one of the following labels: Favor, Against, Irrelevant, or Neutral.

It emphasizes the negative impact of his behavior on Ghana or criticizes the lack of consequences for Uruguayâ€™s win. Irrelevant: The text does not discuss or express an opinion about Luis Suarezâ€™s handball.

It simply describes the event without taking a clear position. Examples- Comment - "By apolosing he would look stupid because players do worst than that I saw goalkeepers attack players and break there foot already to avoid them from scoring" Target - Favor Reason - The commenter is simply justfying Luis's actions since much worse has already been done by players before in the same game. Comment - "The rules should get changed at that point even if it doesnâ€™t happen often. If a ball gets stopped on the line illegally the goal should count. In basketball itâ€™s similar. If a player stops the ball going to the basket and already being in a downfall it counts as 2 or 3 points immediately."

Comment - "Why are they mad at Suarez anyways? They should be mad at their guy missing a penalty kick."

Comment - "Ghana fans call the handball unsportsmanlike but when they see him crying when Uruguay gets knocked out they make fun of him. Stupid logic." Target - Neutral Reason - The commentor is not taking any sides and showing the disbolical nature of people who abuses Luis because of his actions and the same people make fun of him when he is unable to make the team win. Comment - "If it was Jorge Fucile that saved (the other defender on the line who also tried handballing it) most people probably wouldn't blame him it's just cuz people don't like suarez" Target - Favor Reason - The commentor is stating a fact about the image of Luis's image in the poeple's eyes and how people would have had accused even if he did not handball.

    "Frank Lampard Ghost Goal": "Prompt for Stance Detection on Frank Lampard Ghost Goal Controversy Background information regarding the controversy- The Frank Lampard Ghost Goal occurred during a 2010 FIFA World Cup Round of 16 match between England and Germany. The incident became one of the most talked-about moments of the tournament, and it sparked widespread discussions about goal-line technology in football. The Incident: In the first half of the match, with Germany leading 2-1, Frank Lampard, an England midfielder, took a powerful shot from outside the penalty area. The ball hit the crossbar, bounced down, and clearly crossed the goal line, but the referee and linesmen did not award a goal, allowing play to continue. England's players protested, but the officials did not change their decision. Impact on the Match: England would have leveled the score at 2-2 had                                                                                                     the goal been awarded, but the match continued with Germany maintaining their lead. Germany ultimately won the game 4-1, eliminating England from the tournament. The disallowed goal became a major point of controversy. Post-Incident Reaction: There was widespread outrage from England fans, players, and pundits, who argued that the incorrect decision had affected the outcome of the match. Many called for the introduction of goal-line technology to prevent such errors in the future. FIFA later acknowledged the mistake, and this incident played a crucial role in speeding up the introduction of goal-line technology in professional football. Significance: The "Ghost Goal" incident was a turning point in football regarding the use of technology. Following the controversy, FIFA implemented goal-line technology in major competitions to ensure that similar incidents would not happen again. Your Task Choose one of the labels from the following for stance detection- Favor: The text or opinion supports the idea that Frank Lampard's goal should have been awarded and emphasizes the need for fair officiating or the introduction of goal-line technology. It reflects agreement with the claim that the referees made a mistake by not allowing the goal. Against: The text or opinion argues against the importance of the disallowed goal or suggests that it did not significantly change the outcome of the match. It may downplay the controversy or defend the referee's decision, even if the goal was not awarded. Neutral: The text or opinion acknowledges the event but does not explicitly take a stance for or against the disallowed goal. It presents the situation without offering an opinion on whether the goal should have been allowed or whether it affected the match. Irrelevant: The text or opinion does not relate to the Frank Lampard ghost goal controversy at all or discusses unrelated topics. Examples: Comment: I wonder what Germans think to unsporting behaviour They don't think ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Label: Favor Comment: What a disgrace this Manuel is Label: Favor Reason: The comment is about the goal keeper who's distraction and carelessnes made a mistake which is a boon for his country(Germany) and the opposite for England footballer Lampard. Comment: This was way more a clear cut decision that the final of 1966. In that case, I can see how it was a hard thing to judge. This goal from Lampard in 2010 was not at all hard. It's just a normal fotball goal rhat was never allowed Label: Neutral Reason: The comment is just giving his/her reviews on the goal, quoting the 1966 Geoff HUsrt incident and the Lampard 2010 controversy and not taking any sides. Comment: Revenge for 66 Label: Against Reason: The 1966 Geoff Hurst "ghost goal" controversy took place during the FIFA World Cup Final between England and West Germany at Wembley Stadium on **July 30, 1966**. In extra time, with the match tied 2-2, Englandâ€™s Geoff Hurst fired a shot that hit the crossbar, bounced down, and appeared to land near or on the goal line. The key question was whether the ball had fully crossed the line. Swiss referee Gottfried Dienst unsure of the call, consulted with Soviet linesman **Tofiq Bahramov**, who ruled it a goal, giving England a 3-2 lead. Despite West German protests, the goal stood. England went on to win 4-2, with Hurst scoring a historic hat-trick. The incident sparked a long-standing debate, as replays and later analyses have been inconclusive about whether the ball actually crossed the line. It became one of the most controversial moments in World Cup history, influencing the eventual introduction of goal-line technology decades later. Comment: After the VAR decision of 2022 and 2024 I kinda miss these Label: Irrelevant Comment: Avenged. July 10th 2024 Label: Against Reason: The comment is in regards to the 1966 GEoff Hurst GHost goal controversy in which the goal was awarded to the England and the same England team is not awarded the goal for the "GHost Goal" controversy thing. Comment: this was the revenge for Wembley 1966 Label: Against Comment: Took destiny 44 years to get back at England Label: Against Reason: The year count of 44 years is referring to the 1966 GHost GOal controversy in which England was awarded the goal but not in 2010 Lampard case. Comment: Disgusting wasnt given, but maybe karma for 1966 in same fixture in the final when goal was given when it seemed to land on the line Label: Against Comment: Well 1966 the goal was given because the assist referee was influenced by Hurst's reaction as he later admitted (it doesn't matter if the ball crossed the line or not), the swiss referee had not seen a goal and asked the assist. Here is a similar situation, Neuer pretended that nothing happened and brought the ball very quick back into the game. The refs were influenced by this. Reactions mattered in both games. The worst part is that in both cases the refs were absolutely useless. At least we have today technology and video proof to prevent situations like that as good as possible. But it boggles my mind that they still make mistakes despite having four referes on the field and 3 individuals that review the tv footage. Label: Favor Comment: Stop comparing this to Hurst's goal in 1966. In that case, the ball most likely did fall on the line and wasn't a goal. But it's impossible to say for certain with the footage we have. It was a tight call for the linesman. It is the kind of call they routinely made mistakes on in the days before slow mo replays. This just happened to be in such a high profile game. I wouldn't blame England or even the referees for this. There were also no Jumbotrons in the stadium in 1966 replaying it. Unlike Hurst's goal, the debate over Lampard's goal was settled in less than a minute after just one replay. And the fact that there was no goal line technology even as late as 2010 when several other sports had video assisted technology is just ridiculous. So it was a true injustice. Label: Favor Comment: i remember the shitstorm that was caused by this Label: Neutral Comment: What a shame. Label: Neutral Constraint: Answer with only one of the option above that is most accurate along with your reason for choosing that particular label in a valid JSON format given below and nothing else. Now, classify the following comment: Comment: {comment} Format: {{ "Response": {{ "Option": "CHOSEN_OPTION", "Reason" : "YOUR_REASON" }} }} Remember to abide by the rules set above and only return a valid JSON object as the result described above and remember to choose the lables provided above only and nothing else alongwith your reason in the above format."
